# Benjamin Young's Personal Website

## Getting Started
if you are on mac you probably want to install docker for mac [https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/]
From the root of the project (here) you want to run the following commands to run this website locally:

```
cd v1.0.0
docker-compose up
```
you can now visit your website here : http://localhost:3000

I cannot login at the moment but all the pages seem workable, the only issue currently is if you hit a link it will take you the your old website
you just need to change:

http://benjaminthebroker.com/ 
<br />
to
<br />
http://localhost:3000
